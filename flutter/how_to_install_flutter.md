## Setting Up the Flutter Environment

Before we start coding, we need to set up the Flutter development environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Download and install Flutter SDK from [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Editor**: Use an editor like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, which has Flutter and Dart plugins.
- **Device**: An emulator or a physical device to run your app.

### Installation

1. **Install Flutter SDK**:
   - Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system.
   - Unzip it to your desired location.
   - Add the `flutter/bin` directory to your system `PATH`.

2. **Install an Editor**:
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
   - Add Flutter and Dart plugins.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
